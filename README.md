A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/selcukcura/pen/LMdqpq](https://codepen.io/selcukcura/pen/LMdqpq).

Playing around with some micro interactions, animations and transitions for a portfolio redesign. 

- No longer using jQuery as I'm trying to use vanilla JS more.
- Most interactions are simple CSS transforms and transitions. 
- Intro is enhanced with Greensock (GSAP).
